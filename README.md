Our project is about creating an NLP sentiment analysis system for viewer comments on YouTube videos. The objective is to classify each comment as positive, negative or neutral. In a recent update rolled out by YouTube, the dislike count on videos was made private such that it is now only visible to the creator. Comparing the like vs dislike count used to be the obvious way to assess the publicâ€™s opinion of any given video and hence its success. However, with the new update, this is no longer possible. A potential alternative is to study the proportion of positive and negative comments but neither YouTube nor the user who is commenting label the comment as positive, negative or neutral. This is where our system comes in to carry out this multiclass classification problem and hence facilitate an understanding of audience feedback.
